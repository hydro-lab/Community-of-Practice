# Community of Practice  
Science students typically have a range of computer backgrounds but frequently need computer tools at some point.  You are not alone.  Unfortunately, the knowledge might not reside within one lab group for the task you need right now.  This repository (mainly set up for the discussion board) is meant to unite students across lab groups and departments to help with collective problem solving for computer/coding/data questions.  

Please visit when you have questions or have a spare moment to reply to others' questions.  You never know when someone will have a question to which you know the answer.  Moreover, remember that if something has an answer, you may have another method or hint to improve the body of knowledge.  

Of course, both GitHub's and Duquesne University's conduct expectations apply.  Please be helpful.
